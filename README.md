# Gatling-MQTT-Protocol

_Gatling-MQTT-Protocol_ is an unofficial plugin for the [Gatling](http://gatling.io) load testing framework.
 It enables usage and measurement of performances of services using [MQTT](http://mqtt.org/) pub/sub protocol.

The plugin provides gatling actions corresponding to the high level commands of the MQTT protocol.
 This allows better measurement of the MQTT server performance, and customizable scenario. 
 
Two different mqtt clients can be used out of the box to run the tests:

* [_Fusesource_ MQTT](https://github.com/fusesource/mqtt-client) Java client
* [_Paho_](https://eclipse.org/paho/clients/java/) Java client

Alternatively, it is possible to use a custom implementation of the _MqttClient_ actor. See below for details.

## Installation

Locally, build and add the plugin into the `lib` directory of Gatling home.

1. Checkout the code, and build the plugin using [sbt](http://www.scala-sbt.org/)

```bash
$ sbt assembly
```

2. Copy the generated _jar_ into the Gatling library directory

```bash
$ cp target/scala-2.12/gatling-mqtt-protocol-assembly-{VERSION}.jar ${GATLING_HOME}/lib
```

It is also possible to use the plugin on [Flood.io](https://flood.io/). 
Please refer to the ad-hoc [documentation](https://help.flood.io/advanced-configuration/custom-libraries) on how to
add custom library to Flood IO.

## Integration into a scala project

_Gatling-MQTT-Protocol_ is available on Maven Central.
 
It is possible to import Gatling and the _Gatling-MQTT-Protocol_ plugin into your scala project source using sbt and 
the [Gatling SBT Plugin](https://gatling.io/docs/current/extensions/sbt_plugin/). 

Check the [compatibility matrix](#compatibility). Ensure you're using the right version of scala, gatling and
the plugin.

## Documentation

### Quickstart

_Gatling-MQTT-Protocol_ plugin provides a _protocol configuration_ and multiple _actions_ to build
a Gatling simulation.

1. Import the following packages into your Simulation file

```scala
import com.github.jeanadrien.gatling.mqtt.Predef._
import io.gatling.core.Predef._
import scala.concurrent.duration._
```

2. Configure the MQTT Client.

```scala
val mqttConf = mqtt.host("tcp://localhost:1883")
```

3. Define your _Scenario_ in your simulation file using provided _actions_.

```scala
val scn = scenario("MQTT Test")
            .exec(connect)
            .exec(subscribe("myTopic"))
            .during(20 minutes) {
                pace(1 second).exec(publish("myTopic", "myPayload"))
            }
setUp(scn.inject(rampUsers(5000) over (10 minutes))).protocols(mqttConf)
```

The above _Scenario_ connects up to 5000 MQTT clients to your localhost MQTT server at a rate of 500 clients per minute.
Each connected client subscribes to `myTopic` and then issues one _PUBLISH_ command on that same `myTopic` topic each
second. Therefore, the resulting performance test ramps up from 0 to 300k _PUBLISH_ rpm. 

### MQTT Protocol configuration

These options are configurable using _method chaining_ on the `mqtt` object. They are based on the _Fusesource MQTT-Client_ 
available options: https://github.com/fusesource/mqtt-client#controlling-mqtt-options. 

* `host(host: Expression[String])`
* `clientId(clientId: Expression[String])` : Default is a random String, and it is probably a good choice in the context
 of load tests since client ID must be unique.
* `cleanSession(cleanSession: Boolean)` : Default is true
* `keepAlive(keepAlive: Short)` : Interval in seconds between client _PINGREQ_ messages. Default is 30
* `userName(userName: Expression[String])`
* `password(password: Expression[String])`
* `willTopic(willTopic: Expression[String])`
* `willMessage(willMessage: Expression[String])`
* `willQos(willQos: QoS)`
* `willRetain(willRetain: Boolean)`
* `version(version: Expression[String])` : MQTT protocol version. Default is 3.1
* `connectAttemptsMax(connectAttemptsMax: Long)`
* `reconnectAttemptsMax(reconnectAttemptsMax: Long)`
* `reconnectDelay(reconnectDelay: Long)`
* `reconnectDelayMax(reconnectDelayMax: Long)`
* `reconnectBackOffMultiplier(reconnectBackOffMultiplier: Double)`
* `receiveBufferSize(receiveBufferSize: Int)` _Fusesource client only_
* `sendBufferSize(sendBufferSize: Int)` _Fusesource client only_
* `trafficClass(trafficClass: Int)` _Fusesource client only_
* `maxReadRate(maxReadRate: Int)` _Fusesource client only_
* `maxWriteRate(maxWriteRate: Int)` _Fusesource client only_

### Scenario actions

_Gatling-MQTT-Protocol_ plugin provides the following scenario _actions_:

* `connect` : _CONNECT_ MQTT command. Must run at the beginning of the scenario, before any publish / subscribe actions.
* `subscribe(topic : Expression[String])` : _SUBSCRIBE_ MQTT command. Client subscribes to one topic.
* `publish(topic : Expression[String], payload : Expression[Array[Byte]])` : _PUBLISH_ MQTT command. Client publishes
the given payload on the given topic.

Additionally to this `publish` (and forget) action, two additional publish actions are available. They perform the
 PUBLISH command and expect to receive an _echo_ notification from the MQTT server on the same _topic_. 
 These actions are useful to measure the round-trip performances of the MQTT server. I.e. the time between the PUBLISH 
 command is sent, and the _echo_ PUBLISH command is received back from the server.
Note that the client __must__ subscribe to the topic first in the Gatling scenario, otherwise the actions will fail with a _timeout_.

* `publishAndWait(topic : Expression[String], payload : Expression[Array[Byte]])` : _PUBLISH_ MQTT command. The action
does not call the next chained action until the client listener receives the _echo_ payload. 
* `publishAndMeasure(topic : Expression[String], payload : Expression[Array[Byte]])` : _PUBLISH_ MQTT command. Unlike
the _andWait_ version, the next chained action is called immediately after the PUBLISH command, but the plugin waits
for the echo notification to measure the duration of the round-trip.

* Last, a `waitForMessages` action is provided to terminate the scenario. It does nothing but waits until all the pending 
`publishAndMeasure` actions receive their notifications.

#### Connect options

The `connect` action provides the following options using _method chaining_. They are a subset of the protocol
configuration options described here above and allow _threads_ to connect with different client settings e.g. by using a gatling _feeder_. 

* `clientId(clientId: Expression[String])`
* `cleanSession(cleanSession: Boolean)`
* `userName(userName: Expression[String])`
* `password(password: Expression[String])`
* `willTopic(willTopic: Expression[String])`
* `willMessage(willMessage: Expression[String])`
* `willQos(willQos: QoS)`
* `willRetain(willRetain: Boolean)`

#### Subscribe options

The `subscribe` action provides the following MQTT options using _method chaining_ :

* `qosAtMostOnce` : Ask for a _QoS_ of 0 (at most once) for the subscribed topic. 
* `qosAtLeastOnce` : Ask for a _QoS_ of 1 (at least once) for the subscribed topic.
* `qosExactlyOnce` : Ask for a _QoS_ of 2 (exactly once) for the subscribed topic.


#### Publish and publishAndWait options

The `publish`, `publishAndWait` and `publishAndMeasure` actions provide the following options using _method chaining_

* `qosAtMostOnce` : Publish with a _QoS_ of 0 (at most once).
* `qosAtLeastOnce` : Publish with a _QoS_ of 1 (at least once).
* `qosExactlyOnce` : Publish with a _QoS_ of 2 (exactly once).
* `retain(newRetain : Boolean)` : Set the retain flag of the _PUBLISH_ command. Default: false.

Additionally `publishAndwait` provides useful options to define how to _validate_ the
feedback notification received from the server :

* `payloadFeedback(fn : Array[Byte] => Array[Byte] => Boolean)` : Define the comparison function to use when notifications
are received on the subscribed topic. The default function compares each byte of the payload.
* `timeout(duration : FiniteDuration)` : Timeout before failure.

#### WaitForMessages options

* `timeout(duration : FiniteDuration)` : Timeout duration.

### Note about metrics

The time measured for the different actions is:

* `connect` : Time to get successfully connected. Note that in case of connection failure, the connection is automatically 
retried, and a single _connect_ action can potentially lead to several _KO_ requests in the statistics.
* `subscribe` : Time to get the _SUBACK_ message back from the server
* `publish` : Time to perform the full _PUBLISH_ negotiation, the amount of commands necessary depends of the selected _QoS_. 
* `publishAndWait` : Time to perform the publish and receive the notification on the topic. Upper bound is the configured _timeout_

## Examples

You can find Simulation examples in the [test directory](src/test/scala)

## Client injection

_gatling-mqtt-protocol_ uses Typesafe config library for configuration mechanism. 
The setting key `mqtt.client` defines the class name of the `MqttClient` implementation.

Two implementations are packaged with the plugin:

* `com.github.jeanadrien.gatling.mqtt.client.FuseSourceMqttClient`
* `com.github.jeanadrien.gatling.mqtt.client.PahoMqttClient`
 
Other custom clients can be implemented. They need to extend this 
 [`MqttClient`](src/main/scala/com/github/jeanadrien/gatling/mqtt/client/MqttClient.scala) abstract class, which in 
 its turn extends _Actor_

It also possible to select which implementation to use programmatically in the test code:

```scala
MqttClient.clientInjection = { config =>
    Props(new PahoMqttClient(config))
}
```

## Acknowledgments

_Gatling-MQTT-Protocol_ is a rewrite of [Gatling-MQTT](https://github.com/mnogu/gatling-mqtt) plugin. Another unofficial
 Gatling plugin which provides a MQTT connect+publish stress test, also based on _Fusesource_ MQTT Client. 

In this extended version, we aim to increase flexibility in MQTT scenario, abstract the MQTT client 
and provide better performance metrics.

The protocol configuration DSL is widely compliant with by _Gatling-MQTT_
